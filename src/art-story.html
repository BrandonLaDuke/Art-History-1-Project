      <h1>Project Story</h1>
      <h3>Art History 1 &nbsp; | &nbsp; 7 June, 2017</h3>
      <p>I created the final project on Hans Holbein the Younger because during the class one day we looked at the picture that I have included on the home page that has a perspective effect. If you look at the picture from the far right side you will see a skull in the photo. But, that's not it. I also decided on him because of his name was diffrent. Instead of being called Hans Holbein II to denote he was the second. He got the name the Younger.</p>
      <p>I made this web app with Polymer! My favorite web technology! I used the "app-route" element along with the PRPL pattern to ensure that the app loads with very fast speeds on all device types. Authough due to not enough time the home page is not responsive like the rest of the site.</p>
      <p>I hope you like it!</p>
